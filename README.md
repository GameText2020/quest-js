QuestJS
=======

QuestJS an app (and online service) which takes in a [Quest 5](https://github.com/textadventures/quest) .quest file
and spits out a folder full of HTML, CSS and JS.

This allows any game to be converted into something that will run stand-alone in a web browser. The
files could also be wrapped with [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) to create an app.

To run QuestJS on Windows, [download the latest release](https://github.com/textadventures/quest-js/releases).

If you're not using Windows (or just don't want to download anything), try the [web version](http://questjs.azurewebsites.net/compile).

This software is at an early alpha stage, and you will very likely encounter problems! When you experience a bug, please [add an issue](https://github.com/textadventures/quest-js/issues) and give as much detail as you can. You can email files to alex@textadventures.co.uk.
