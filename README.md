Quest 6
=======

Quest 6 is the next version of the [Quest](http://textadventures.co.uk/quest/) text adventure game development platform.

For background, see Alex Warren's post [Some initial thoughts on Quest 6](http://forum.textadventures.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=3816)

Right now, the code checked in here is a Windows desktop app which will take in a Quest 5 .quest file
and spit out a folder full of HTML, CSS and JS.
