QuestJS
=======

QuestJS is a Windows desktop app which will take in a Quest 5 .quest file
and spit out a folder full of HTML, CSS and JS.

This allows any game to be converted into something that will run stand-alone in a web browser. The
files could also be wrapped with [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) to create an app.
